geOrchestra is a complete **Spatial Data Infrastructure** solution.

It features a **metadata catalog** (GeoNetwork 3.8), an **OGC server** (GeoServer 2.17) with fine-grained access control (based on GeoFence), an **advanced viewer and editor**, an **extractor** and **many more** (security and auth system based on proxy/CAS/LDAP, analytics, admin UIs, ...)

## Releases

There are major and patch releases:
 * Major releases are supported during 12 months.
 * Migrating from one patch release to another does not require any configuration change. It is highly recommended.

Have a look at the [version numbering scheme](releases.md) and the [release notes](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/releases) for more information.


## Install

Depending on your goals and skills, there are several ways to install geOrchestra:

 * a [docker composition](https://github.com/georchestra/docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml), which pulls pre-built images from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/georchestra/), is perfect for a quick start. Provided you have a good download speed and recent machine (8Gb required), you'll be up and running within 10 minutes. Read [how to run geOrchestra on Docker](https://github.com/georchestra/docker/blob/master/README.md) here. Use the branch matching the target version (`master` for dev purposes).
 * a contributed [ansible playbook](https://github.com/georchestra/ansible) allows you to spin an instance in a few minutes. This is probably the easiest way to create a small server, since it takes care of installing the middleware, fetching the webapps and configuring them. Same as above: use the branch matching target version.
 * [debian packages](https://packages.georchestra.org/) are perfect to create complex production architectures, but you'll have to [install and configure the middleware](setup.md) first. The community provides these packages on a "best effort" basis, with no warranty at all.
 * you could also use the [generic wars](https://packages.georchestra.org/) with their "[datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir)", as an alternate method. The above packages provide both.
 * finally, [building from the sources](build.md) is also possible, but only relevant when customizations are needed. One gets custom WAR files, packages or docker images that can be [deployed](deploy.md) to dev, test, or production servers.

If you opt for the middleware setup by yourself, there are several [optimizations](optimizations.md), [good practices](good_practices.md) and [tutorials](tutorials.md) that are worth reading.
Note that the minimum system requirement is 2 cores and 8Gb RAM, but we recommend at least 4 cores and 16 Gb RAM for a production instance.
More RAM is of course better !
