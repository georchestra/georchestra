# Configuring datahub

The `default.toml` file is the main configuration file for the datahub. It is located in the `datahub/conf` subfolder of the [georchestra datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir/). Below are the main sections in the file.

Please note that the current documentation focuses on the main points and specifics of integration into geOrchestra. The full configuration options can be found in the [geonetwork-ui documentation](https://geonetwork.github.io/geonetwork-ui/main/docs/guide/configure.html).

## Global settings

The most important parameter is `geonetwork4_api_url` which should point at the API of the geonetwork instance. The default value `/geonetwork/srv/api` is a sensible one if datahub is installed on the same domain as geonetwork.

For the `metadata_language` there are 3 options:

  * either specify a ISO 639 language code, eg: `fre` or `eng` or `ger` - in this case only datasets matching this language code will be returned.
  * `current` - only datasets matching the current interface language will be shown.
  * If commented out, no language preference is applied for the search wich means, all languages are shown.

The other options can probably be left unmodified.

## Theme

Here are the main options:

* `primary_color` applies to the first line of the title.
* `secondary_color` applies to the second line of the title.
* `main_color` applies to the dataset description.
* `thumbnail_placeholder` it is recommanded to set it so that datasets without thumbnail or a broken thumbnail are shown with this fallback image.

## Search

There are several options to fine tune the search experience.

### More relevant search results

The datahub has an option to boost search results which are more relevant to the end user, based on a geographic perimeter.
geOrchestra leverages this option by offering a service which dynamically provides the organization's area of competence for the connected user (Note that this depends on the console application's configuration, as the `competenceAreaEnabled` option is set to `false` by default).
This allows for a dynamic boost of search results which are supposed to be more relevant to the end user.

These 2 options are mutually exclusive (one only should be present in the configuration file):

 * `filter_geometry_data` - if set to a static GeoJSON object, all datasets contained **inside** the Polygon geometry will be boosted on top.
 * `filter_geometry_url` - if set to ``"/console/account/areaofcompetence"``, the datahub uses the current (connected) user's organization's perimeter to boost search results.

 Whatever the selected option, results will be shown in the following order:

 * results contained **inside** the geometry
 * results **intersecting** the geometry
 * all other results

## Metadata quality widget

## Map settings

* the parameters `max_zoom`, `max_extent` and `external_viewer_open_new_tab` are obvious.
* If a WMS web service has been declared as a resource in the dataset, it can be pushed into a map viewer (in a new tab: `external_viewer_url_template = true` ). The `external_viewer_url_template` parameter allows to define the URL to this viewer displaying the selected layer.


## Translations

Translations can be customized / overriden in the application config file:

 * identify the translation key which is used by the application in the [`translations/`](https://github.com/geonetwork/geonetwork-ui/tree/main/translations) folder. eg `datahub.header.title.html` is the translation key which is used by default to provide the french title, as seen in the `fr.json` file (```"datahub.header.title.html": "<div class=\"text-white\">Toutes les données<br>publiques de mon organisation</div>"```).
 * if required, create a `[translations.fr]` section in the `default.toml` file
 * insert below the custom translation, eg ```datahub.header.title.html = '<div class="text-white">Toutes les données <br> de ma plateforme</div>'```

# Organizations and their thumbnails

The datahub is a standalone application which can be deployed independently of geOrchestra. Hence, organizations which are shown in the "Organizations" tab of the application stem from the metadata assets and only from the metadata assets. More precisely, organizations are named by the first resource contact of the metadata.

But geOrchestra has also its own "organization" objects, which can be managed with the help of the console application, and often get synchronised with the GeoNetwork groups. geOrchestra "organization" objects may have a thumbnail, but this is not the one which gets displayed by the datahub.

This makes it difficult to handle for now. We're working on a solution to this problem.

In the mean time, to ensure that an organization featured by the datahub has its own thumbnail, it is recommended to edit at least one of the metadata which references this organization.

When editing in "full view", the logo can be found:
- for a ISO19115-3 metadata: `Identification` tab > `Point of contact` > `Responsibility` > `Party` > `Organization` > `Logo`
- for a ISO19139 metadata: `Identification` tab > `Point of contact` > `Responsible party` > `Contact information` > `Contact` > `Contact instructions`


Alternatively, if metadata editing is not an option, it is possible to create a group in GeoNetwork with the same name as the organization provided by the metadata and set a logo for it.
This method is not ideal as it can lead to inconsistencies between the console and GeoNetwork.
