# User rights management

Rights management is done using the [roles](../roles.md) assigned to a [user](../users.md). By creating new roles, you can design more access rules.

This is on a per-applications basis. Some applications are likely to make use of new roles, others not so much.

Here is a list of core applications that can use new roles and how to leverage it:

- [GeoNetwork](acl-geonetwork.md)
- [GeoServer](acl-geoserver.md)
- [GeoFence](acl-geofence.md)
- [MapStore](acl-mapstore.md)
- [Cadastrapp](https://docs.georchestra.org/cadastrapp/latest/guides_techniques/installer/roles_ldap/)

Some other core applications also can leverage new roles, but require access to the configuration files, which is more technical and usually restricted to sysadmin users. They are documented [in the technical guides](../rights_management/index.md).
