# What is `georchestra/console`

**Console** is a module for geOrchestra which allow:
- public users to create accounts/reset their passwords.
- administrators to manage users, organisations and roles.
- registered users to edit their account details.

A [complete description](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/blob/master/console/README.md) is available on github .

# How to use this image

As for every other geOrchestra webapp, its configuration resides in the data directory ([datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir)), typically something like /etc/georchestra, where it expects to find a console sub-directory.

It is recommended to use the official docker composition: https://github.com/georchestra/docker.

For this specific component, see the section `console` in the [`georchestra/docker/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/georchestra/docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file.

## Where is it built

This image is built using maven : `../mvnw package docker:build -Pdocker` in `georchestra` repo `console/` folder.
