# What is `georchestra/geoserver`

**Geoserver** is a module for geOrchestra which offers
- a Map and Feature server compliant with OGC standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, CSW, ...)

geOrchestra's Geoserver is a fork of [GeoServer](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver).


# How to use this image

As for every other geOrchestra webapp, its configuration resides in the data directory ([datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir)), typically something like /etc/georchestra, where it expects to find a geoserver sub-directory.

It is recommended to use the official docker composition: https://github.com/georchestra/docker.

For this specific component, see the section `geoserver` in the [`georchestra/docker/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/georchestra/docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file.

## Where is it built

This image is built using maven : `./mvnw -Pdocker package docker:build` in [`georchestra`](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra) repo.
