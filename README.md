[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/georchestra/georchestra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/georchestra/georchestra)

geOrchestra is a complete **Spatial Data Infrastructure** solution.

It features a **metadata catalog** (GeoNetwork 3.0.4), an **OGC server** (GeoServer 2.8.2 and GeoWebCache 1.8.0) with fine-grained access control (based on GeoFence), an **advanced viewer and editor**, an **extractor** and **many more** (security and auth system based on proxy/CAS/LDAP, analytics, admin UIs, ...)

## Releases

A new release is published every 6 months and is supported during 12 months. Stable versions are named by their release date, eg 14.06 was published in June 2014.  

Before downloading, you might be interested in the [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) and the [kanban board](https://huboard.com/georchestra/georchestra) we're using to manage issues.

## Download

To download the latest stable version (currently 15.12), use the following command line:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra.git ~/georchestra
```

## Install

To install geOrchestra, you will have to:
 * [create your own configuration repository](doc/config.md), based on the [template](https://github.com/georchestra/template) we provide,
 * [build the web applications](doc/build.md) with your config,
 * [setup the middleware](doc/setup.md) (apache, tomcat, postgresql, openldap),
 * [deploy the webapps](doc/deploy.md), [check](doc/check.md) they're working as expected and finally [configure](doc/post-deploy_config.md) them.

There are also several [optimizations](doc/optimizations.md), [good practices](doc/good_practices.md) and [tutorials](doc/tutorials.md) that are worth reading.

The minimum system requirement is 2 cores and 4Gb RAM, but we recommend at least 4 cores and 8 Gb RAM for a production instance.
More RAM is of course better !
