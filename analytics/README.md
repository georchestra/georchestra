Analytics
=========

Analytics is a GUI which displays **monthly** and **global** statistics on platform usage: **GeoNetwork downloads**, **custom data extractions** & **OGC web services consumption**.


It relies on two other modules to collect figures in a database:
 * [downloadform](downloadform/README.md) for GeoNetwork downloads & custom data extractions,
 * [ogc-server-statistics](ogc-server-statistics/README.md) for OGC web services consumption


With regards to **GeoNetwork downloads**, you get a nice view of:
 * metadata id, filename, number of hits
 * username, number of downloads
 * organisation, number of downloads

For **custom data extractions**:
 * service type, service URL, layer name, hits
 * username, number of requests
 * organisation, number of requests
 
For **OGC web services consumption**:
 * service type, layer name, request type (getmap/getfeature/getcapabilities/...), hits
 * username, number of requests
 * organisation, number of requests

Each table can be exported to CSV for easy offline use.

If one needs to plug a different client, the [analytics API doc](API.md) may be handy.
