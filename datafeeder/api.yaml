                   The response encoding is always UTF-8. The 'encoding' parameter can be used to force reading the native data in a different charset.
                   The returned geometry CRS is controlled by the "srs", and "srsOverride" query parameters.
                   If none is provided, the geometry is returned as-is, in the dataset's native CRS (possibly null).
                   The "srsOverride" parameter allows to override the dataset's native CRS, which also means assuming a native CRS when the
                   dataset didn't provide a native CRS (e.g. a shapefile uploaded without .prj side-car file).
                   The "srs" parameter specifies the output geometry CRS. The geometry will be reprojected from the source CRS to the output CRS.
