# From 22.x to 23.0.x

## GeoNetwork 4.0 to 4.2 migration notes

### UI settings

On /geonetwork/srv/fre/admin.console#/settings/ui one should compare after the migration the full JSON file with the one provided for a fresh install (see https://github.com/georchestra/geonetwork/blob/5be6c4f07922e2c91097bfb79f8201afc979165e/web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/setup/sql/data/data-db-default.sql#L769-L1390)

Some attention notes:
 * `"showMosaic": false` in the `home` section will disable the often clumsy display of metadata thumbnails on the home page
 * `"queryBase"` check for the `"any.${searchLang}:(${any}) OR any.common:(${any}) OR resourceTitleObject.${searchLang}:(${any})^2 OR resourceTitleObject.\\*:\"${any}\"^6"` value if searches return no metadata

### Virtual CSWs and subportals

The new GeoNetwork version dropped support for what was called "virtual CSW" (basically
a CSW endpoint filtered by a custom Lucene query on the index), in favor of the "subportals".

You will find in this directory a python script named `migrate-virtual-csw-to-subportals.py`,
which can be used as a base to convert virtual CSWs to subportals.

To ensure backward compatibility with previously expected CSW endpoints, you will have to rewrite the
URLs into your webserver configuration as follows:

```
from:
/geonetwork/srv/(.*)/csw-(.*)
to:
/geonetwork/csw-$2/$1/csw
```

## GeoServer

In Docker context we've set new java option GEOWEBCACHE_CONFIG_DIR to /mnt/geoserver_datadir/gwc.

So you may need to move following files from `geowebcache_tiles` to `geoserver_datadir/gwc`:
- geowebcache.xml
- geowebcache-diskquota.xml
- geowebcache-diskquota-jdbc.xml

## Homepage / Proxy

In geochestra/docker, we've added a container named *static* based on Nginx with the home page.

As we want to serve the home page on URL "/", the default route in traefik is now the *static* container.

If you have custom services behind proxy, you might need to add some `ProxyPath` directives in proxy labels to route corresponding requests through *proxy* container.

ex:

```
services:
  proxy:
    labels:
     - >-
        traefik.http.routers.proxy.rule=Host(`georchestra-127-0-1-1.traefik.me`) && (
        PathPrefix(`/_static`)
        || PathPrefix(`/login`)
        || PathPrefix(`/usedetails`)
        ...
        )
```

You might need to reuse or adapt those changes for your setup.




## LDAP

The `idatafeeder` user was added to the ldap schema.

This user is internally used by datafeeder to import datasets and metadata into geoserver and geonetwork.

To upgrade the ldap, use the following command with the [ldap_migration.ldif](ldap_migration.ldif) file:

```
ldapmodify -H "ldap://ldap:389" -D "cn=admin,dc=georchestra,dc=org" -w "secret" -f ldap_migration.ldif 
```

## Fixing OGC services coming from Géo-IDE

A custom transformation is now available for harvesters pointing at Géo-IDE (French Spatial Infrastructure) services. On such a harvester, in the dropdown "XSL Transformation to apply", select the value:

**GeoIDE-services-OGC**

This will make all records coming from that harvester to have valid WMS/WFS links, enabling their use in the map viewer and Datahub preview.
