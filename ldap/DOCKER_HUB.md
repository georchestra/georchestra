# What is `georchestra/ldap`

**LDAP** is a module for geOrchestra which offers
- LDAP server for geOrchestra users and roles 
- the required files to configure and populate an OpenLDAP directory

# How to use this image

As for every other geOrchestra webapp, its configuration resides in the data directory ([datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir)), typically something like /etc/georchestra, where it expects to find a ldap sub-directory.

It is recommended to use the official docker composition: https://github.com/georchestra/docker.

For this specific component, see the section `ldap` in the [`georchestra/docker/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/georchestra/docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file.

## Where is it built

This image is built using Dockerfile in `georchestra` repo `ldap/` folder.
