# Building geOrchestra

Here are the steps...

## Get the sources

At this stage, if you don't have the geOrchestra sources, you need to download them:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra.git ~/georchestra
```
(go grab some coffee in the mean time, or read on)


## Install the dependencies

You should install the required packages: 
```
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv openjdk-7-jdk ant ant-optional
```

Note that ```openjdk-6-jdk``` works too (but it's not as fast, at least for GeoServer).


## Install your configuration

By default, cloning the geOrchestra repository will also fetch the template configuration in ```~/georchestra/config/configurations/template```.
Since you want to build against your configuration rather than the template one, you'll have to copy it into the ```~/georchestra/config/configurations/myprofile``` directory.

Let's do this with git instead:
```
cd ~/georchestra/config/configurations/
git clone https://gitlab.com/user/myprofile.git
```

Now, you should have your own configuration in ```~/georchestra/config/configurations/myprofile```.  
Let's see if it builds:
```
cd ~/georchestra/config
../mvn -Dserver=myprofile install
```

SUCCESS ? Good, you're ready for the next step.  
If not, you should review carefully the error messages and [ask for help](http://www.georchestra.org/community.html) if you don't understand what happens.

Note that if you're connecting to the internet through proxies, you need to [tell maven how to reach public repositories](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html).

## GeoNetwork

### Important note about the versions

As of december 2015, the default version for GeoNetwork in geOrchestra switched
to the 3.0.4 version. But some existing instances are still relying on features
that are present in the older versions, hence it is still possible to use the
GeoNetwork 2.x versions in geOrchestra.


If you need a 2.x version, you will need to checkout the appropriate version in
your repository before launching the build in the next step.

Assuming a GN2 version is needed and the targeted version of geOrchestra is
the `15.12` one, follow these steps before compiling:

```
cd geonetwork
git checkout georchestra-15.12
```

This step would have to be repeated each time the git submodules are updated
(using one of these commands `git submodule sync`, `git submodule update` ...).


### Migrating from GeoNetwork 2 to 3.0.4

Currently, no method is provided to migrate an older georchestra-geonetwork
database to the new version, you will have to export your data from the old
database by hand, start from an empty Geonetwork3 database, then reimport your
data (using a batch insert for instance).


## Build the modules

Building your SDI is just a command-line away:
```
cd ~/georchestra
export MAVEN_OPTS="-XX:MaxPermSize=256M"
./mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dserver=myprofile clean install
```

Note: this will build **all modules** (except GeoFence).
In case you only want to build one module or a collection, the syntax is a bit different:
```
./mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dserver=myprofile -P-all,module1,module2 clean install
```
... where ```moduleX``` can be one of: ```analytics```, ```cas```, ```catalogapp```, ```downloadform```, ```extractorapp```, ```geonetwork```, ```geofence```, ```geoserver```, ```geowebcache```, ```header```, ```ldapadmin```, ```mapfishapp```, ```security-proxy```.

As a result of the build process, you should find the geOrchestra artifacts into the subfolders of the ```~/.m2/repository/org/``` directory.
Now, let's [prepare the system](setup.md) to receive the webapps.

Are you having problems with the build ?  
Please have a look at our [continuous integration](https://sdi.georchestra.org/ci/job/georchestra-template/). If it builds and yours doesn't, the error is probably on your side.



## Advanced build options

These options are not required to build geOrchestra but they can make your life easier.

### sub.target

With the same config directory, it is possible to manage several environments (typically a production and a test server).
This is achieved through the use of the ```sub.target``` property in the maven command line.

Example:
```
./mvn -Dserver=myprofile -Dsub.target=prod -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install
```

Depending on the ```sub.target``` value, it is possible to alter one or several config options (typically: shared maven filters, but not exclusively). 
The magic happens in your profile's ```build_support/GenerateConfig.groovy``` script, eg with:

```groovy
    def generate(def project, def log, def ant, def basedirFile,
      def target, def subTarget, def targetDir,
      def buildSupportDir, def outputDir) {

        // method added here:
        updateSharedMavenFilters(subTarget)
        
        updateGeoServerProperties()
        updateGeoFenceProperties()
        updateMapfishappMavenFilters()
        updateExtractorappMavenFilters()
        updateSecProxyMavenFilters()
        updateLDAPadminMavenFilters()
    } 

    /**
     * updateSharedMavenFilters
     */
    def updateSharedMavenFilters(subTarget) {
        switch (subTarget) {
            case "test":
                new PropertyUpdate(
                    to: 'shared.maven.filters').update { properties ->
                        properties['shared.server.name'] = "test.georchestra.org"
                        properties['shared.default.log.level'] = "DEBUG"
                        properties['shared.instance.name'] = "geOrchestra demo - TEST"
                }
                break
            case "prod":
                new PropertyUpdate(
                    to: 'shared.maven.filters').update { properties ->
                        properties['shared.server.name'] = "sdi.georchestra.org"
                        properties['shared.default.log.level'] = "WARN"
                }
                break
        }
    }
```

### GeoServer extensions

To build GeoServer with one or several extensions, one can use the profiles defined in the [geoserver/extension](https://github.com/georchestra/geoserver/blob/2.3.2-georchestra/src/extension/pom.xml) and [geoserver/community](https://github.com/georchestra/geoserver/blob/2.3.2-georchestra/src/community/pom.xml) poms.

Example building geoserver only, with the control-flow, css, csw, gdal, inspire, pyramid and wps extensions:
```
./mvn -P-all,geoserver -Pcontrol-flow,css,csw,gdal,inspire,pyramid,wps -Dserver=myprofile -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install 
```

### geoserver.war.excludes

As the name suggests, the ```geoserver.war.excludes``` property allows you to exclude files from the final GeoServer build.

Typically, you will have the native JAI installed, because it performs far better than the java version. 
As a result, the JAI classes are useless for GeoServer.

Build GeoServer with:
```
./mvn -P-all,geoserver '-Dgeoserver.war.excludes=WEB-INF/lib/jai_*.jar' -Dserver=myprofile -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install
```

Another use of the property is when building GeoServer without the integrated GeoWebCache:
```
./mvn -P-all,geoserver '-Dgeoserver.war.excludes=WEB-INF/lib/*gwc*.jar' -Dserver=myprofile -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install
```

Both can be combined with:
```
./mvn -P-all,geoserver '-Dgeoserver.war.excludes=WEB-INF/lib/*gwc*.jar,WEB-INF/lib/jai_*.jar' -Dserver=myprofile -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install
```


### Alternative building process using Docker (experimental)

As of last quarter of 2015, we introduced in geOrchestra the notion of generic
webapps ; it is now possible to use Docker images to run the whole SDI easily.

First, you will need to compile the GeoNetwork and GeoServer artifacts separately:

```
cd geoserver/geoserver-submodule/src
../../../mvn clean install -DskipTests
cd ../../../geonetwork/
../mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Then generate the Docker images (make sure that Docker and docker-compose are
correctly installed before):

From the project root:
```
./mvn clean package docker:build -Pdocker -DskipTests --pl extractorapp,cas-server-webapp,security-proxy,geoserver/webapp,mapfishapp,header,ldapadmin,geonetwork/web,analytics,catalogapp,downloadform,geowebcache-webapp
```

Using the `docker images` command, you should get a listing of the geOrchestra images generated:

```
docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID         ...
[...]
header              latest              XXXXXXXXXXXX     ...
geonetwork          latest              XXXXXXXXXXXX     ...
security-proxy      latest              XXXXXXXXXXXX     ...
mapfishapp          latest              XXXXXXXXXXXX     ...
extractorapp        latest              XXXXXXXXXXXX     ...
ldapadmin           latest              XXXXXXXXXXXX     ...
geoserver           latest              XXXXXXXXXXXX     ...
cas                 latest              XXXXXXXXXXXX     ...
[...]
```


Finally, fire up the whole composition:
```
docker-compose up
```

If no error occured, you should be able to visit `http://localhost:8080/header/`.
