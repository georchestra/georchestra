# How to run geOrchestra on Docker

This guide has moved to the [georchestra/docker](https://github.com/georchestra/docker) repository.


Note: in the above guide, images are pulled from docker hub, which means they've been compiled by our CI.
In case you have to build these images by yourself, please refer to the [docker images build instructions](../docker/README.md).
