/**
 * This is a work around to the fact that spring does not yet support the
 * gateway parameter.
 *
 * <p>
 * In summary the way this works is proxy will call use this class if the
 * requested url is <em>gateway</em>. When this class gets called it returns the
 * contents of WEB-INF/gateway.html to the user. The gateway.html page has an
 * iframe that attempts to load testPage?login. The testPage is restricted to
 * logged in users so it forces a redirect to cas. If the user has logged in
 * then the proxy will get the login information and the user is forwarded to
 * the final destination (as provided by url parameter)
 * </p>
