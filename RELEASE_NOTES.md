UPGRADING:
 * mapfishapp config changes:
    * don't forget to edit your WMCs to activate back buffers on base layers, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/42
    * client side (see GEOR_config.js or GEOR_custom.js for more information):
        * MAP_POS_SRS1 and MAP_POS_SRS2 options have been replaced with POINTER_POSITION_SRS_LIST
        * DEFAULT_WMC option has been replaced with CONTEXTS
        * PRINT_LAYOUTS_ACL allows to fine-tune available printing layouts based on user roles
        * DEFAULT_PRINT_FORMAT is now replaced by DEFAULT_PRINT_LAYOUT
        * DEACCENTUATE_REFERENTIALS_QUERYSTRING option added (controls whether to deaccentuate the referentials widget query string or not)
    * server side:
        * There is a new maven filter for mapfishapp temporary documents: shared.mapfishapp.docTempDir (defaults to /tmp/mapfishapp)
 * In GeoNetwork, it is now recommended to use OGC:WMS protocol rather than OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map (or any other WMS tagged with a version) to declare WMS layers, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/4
