Version 13.06
=============

This release was supported by the French GeoPicardie, GeoBretagne and CIGALsace projects, the GIP ATGeRi and individual contributors.

New features:
 * geoserver: updated to 2.3.2,
 * geoserver: patched to include ScaleHint (WMS 1.1.x) and Min/MaxScaleDenominator (WMS 1.3.0) in the capabilities documents, according to the default layer SLD. The patched was accepted in GeoServer master, see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS-572

Enhancements:
 * the header is now part of the static module, and all webapps make use of it. As a result, requests to static pass through the security-proxy,
 * the header height can be set across all applications by the way of a unique shared maven filter,
 * mapfishapp: the CSW querier filters results on type = dataset OR series,
 * extractorapp: supported output formats combos made configurable, ECW output format expunged by default,
 * the template config was slimmed down: files where default values are suitable for most deployments were moved to config/defaults,
 * the documentation was improved ([mapfishapp](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/blob/master/mapfishapp/README.md#feature-editor), [install](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/blob/master/INSTALL.md), [manage configs](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/blob/master/README.md#how-to-customize-)),
 * we now have CI on JS files syntax with Travis !

Bug fixes:
 * fixed the ability to turn off the downloadform with shared.downloadform.activated,
 * mapfishapp: referentials search now sends the map srs in the WFS query to allow feature reprojection,
 * mapfishapp: fixed incorrect thumbnail URLs in CSW querier,
 * mapfishapp: fixed misaligned thumbnail in CSW querier,
 * mapfishapp: fixed window + grid problems on service opening, see [issue 109](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/109),
 * mapfishapp: fixed error in GEOR.ows.hydrateLayerRecord when falling back to main service,
 * mapfishapp: fixed links to MD sheet, see [issue 110](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/110),
 * mapfishapp: fixed broken legend after styling, see [issue 107](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/107),
 * mapfishapp: more robust handling of incoming WMS server URLs (eg: those with a mapfile GET parameter),
 * geonetwork: fixed ldap attribute mapping.
 
UPGRADING:
 * mapfishapp's default thesaurus has been set to local.theme.test, which is the only one exported by GeoNetwork by default. Feel free to customize to suit your needs,
 * geonetwork upgrade instructions are available [here](https://github.com/georchestra/geonetwork/blob/georchestra-29/README.md).

UPGRADING:
 * LDAP tree needs to be migrated as a result of https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/91 :
    * ldif export: ldapsearch -xLLL -D "cn=admin,dc=georchestra,dc=org" -W > dump.ldif
    * migration: sed 's/\(memberUid: uid=\)\(.*\)\(,ou=users,dc=georchestra,dc=org\)/memberUid: \2/' dump.ldif > new.ldif
    * ldif import
 * mapfishapp config changes:
    * the print config folder should be moved from YOUR_CONFIG/mapfishapp/print to YOUR_CONFIG/mapfishapp/WEB-INF/print for security reasons, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/82
    * client side (see GEOR_config.js or GEOR_custom.js for more information):
        * MAP_POS_SRS1 and MAP_POS_SRS2 options have been replaced with POINTER_POSITION_SRS_LIST
        * DEFAULT_WMC option has been replaced with CONTEXTS

        * There is a new maven filter for mapfishapp temporary documents: shared.mapfishapp.docTempDir (defaults to /tmp/mapfishapp)
    * don't forget to edit your WMCs to activate back buffers on base layers, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/42
 * In GeoNetwork, it is now recommended to use OGC:WMS protocol rather than OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map (or any other WMS tagged with a version) to declare WMS layers, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/4
