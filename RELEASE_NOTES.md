The development branch is master. It can be used for testing and reporting errors.

For production systems, you are advised to use the branch named "stable".
This branch receives bug fixes as they arrive.

Every release is supported for 6 months.
Each time a new release is out, the stable branch is renamed according to the old release version, and a new "stable" branch is forked off master.

The latter grants access to the LDAPadmin private UI (/ldapadmin/privateui/index.html), while the former grants access to the analytics app. See [georchestra/LDAP#2](https://github.com/georchestra/LDAP/pull/2).
 * The default application language is now English: shared.language=en + geonetwork.language=eng + default email templates ... be sure to override these in your own config !
 * Remember also to fill these two new global maven filters: shared.homepage.url for your SDI home page (might be something like http://my.sdi.org/portal/) and shared.instance.name (eg: GeoMyCompany)


Version 13.06 (current stable version)
======================================

This release was supported by the French GeoPicardie, GeoBretagne and CIGALsace projects, the GIP ATGeRi and individual contributors.

 * geonetwork: fixed ldap attribute mapping.
 
UPGRADING:
