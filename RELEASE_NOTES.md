UPGRADING:
 * analytics: the ExtJS submodule path has changed, be sure to run ```git submodule update --init``` when you switch branches.
 * databases: the downloadform, ogcstatistics and ldapadmin databases are now merged into a single one named "georchestra". Each webapp expects to find its tables in a dedicated schema ("downloadform" for the downloadform module, "ogcstatistics" for ogc-server-statistics, and "ldapadmin" for ldapadmin). See https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/535 for the complete patch. If you currently have one dedicated database for each module, you can keep your setup, provided you customize the ```shared.psql.ogc.statistics.db```, ```shared.psql.download_form.db``` & ```shared.ldapadmin.db``` maven filters in your own config. In any case, you'll have to rename the ```download``` schema (of the previous ```downloadform``` database) into ```downloadform```, and migrate the tables which were in the public schema of the databases ```ogcstatistics``` and ```ldapadmin``` into the newly created schemas.
 * download form: the module is disabled by default (```shared.download_form.activated=false```). Be sure to set the value you want in your shared.maven.filters file.
 * extractorapp:
   * ```BUFFER_VALUES``` has changed. If you had a custom value in your GEOR_custom.js file, you have to modify it according to the new syntax.
   * the ```geobretagne_production``` env variable has been removed - see [#97](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/97)
 * geoserver: be sure to set the ```file.encoding``` tomcat option for geoserver to interpret correctly UTF-8 SLDs (read [how](INSTALL.md#geoserver)).
 * ldapadmin: new ```shared.ldapadmin.db``` parameter to specify the ldapadmin database name (defaults to "georchestra").
 * mapfishapp:
   * the ```NS_EDIT``` config option has been removed. By default, all layers served by the platform geoserver are editable (see ```GEOR.custom.EDITABLE_LAYERS```), provided the user has the rights to (defaults to members of ```ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR```, see ```GEOR.custom.ROLES_FOR_EDIT```).
   * the contexts referenced in your ```GEOR.custom.CONTEXTS``` array are now able to reference layers with their full attribution information (text, logo & link). Have a look at the provided [default.wmc](https://github.com/georchestra/template/blob/55f24c8625e737d0b4567db92966c98502578766/mapfishapp/default.wmc#L39).
   * print: some parameters have changed when the print module was updated: ```maxIconWidth``` -> ```iconMaxWidth```, ```maxIconHeight``` -> ```iconMaxHeight``` (see [e6231c](https://github.com/georchestra/template/commit/e6231c8cbf325dfa2bf96fcaa14096fc0c64ab89)).
 * ogcservstatistics - disabled by default: ```shared.ogc.statistics.activated=false```. Be sure to set the value you want in your shared.maven.filters file.
 * static: the "static" module has been renamed into "header": your deployment scripts *must* be adapted, as well as your apache2 configuration (or any other reverse proxy).

Bug fixes:
 * security-proxy: Location header was erroneously removed in some cases, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/commit/fef3d77ab4fe0e6045c47add1f84dbd7de3a8c4e
 * mapfishapp: fixed erroneous WMSC2WMS mapping, which prevented printing of the GeoBretagne OSM baselayer, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/commit/159bd4f24ecb21b9c76f76d27c1736ec1040f0ab
 * mapfishapp: use toponymName instead of name in GeoNames results, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/45
 * mapfishapp: WFS layer source server now correctly displayed, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/commit/945349a1935286af2e02bfd21f9d7d9eeb6481e7
 * mapfishapp: Styler 2nd load timing out fixed, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/commit/7b28656a2a81d01c00ebe0ff5a55e571f43aa63c
 * mapfishapp: download style styler link did not always provide the current layer style, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/commit/5c47caa38b8c975982776f2a35c0574217bc2a17
 * mapfishapp: fixed XML documents missing the prolog, see http://applis-bretagne.fr/redmine/issues/4536
 * mapfishapp: WFS layer redraw was throwing an error, see http://applis-bretagne.fr/redmine/issues/4544
 * LDAP: group membership is now declared with memberUid = user uid rather than full dn, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/91

UPGRADING:
 * LDAP tree needs to be migrated as a result of https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/91 :
    * ldif export: ldapsearch -xLLL -D "cn=admin,dc=georchestra,dc=org" -W > dump.ldif
    * migration: sed 's/\(memberUid: uid=\)\(.*\)\(,ou=users,dc=georchestra,dc=org\)/memberUid: \2/' dump.ldif > new.ldif
    * ldif import
 * mapfishapp config changes:
    * the print config folder should be moved from YOUR_CONFIG/mapfishapp/print to YOUR_CONFIG/mapfishapp/WEB-INF/print for security reasons, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/82
    * client side (see GEOR_config.js or GEOR_custom.js for more information):
        * MAP_POS_SRS1 and MAP_POS_SRS2 options have been replaced with POINTER_POSITION_SRS_LIST
        * DEFAULT_WMC option has been replaced with CONTEXTS
        * PRINT_LAYOUTS_ACL allows to fine-tune available printing layouts based on user roles
        * DEFAULT_PRINT_FORMAT is now replaced by DEFAULT_PRINT_LAYOUT
        * DEACCENTUATE_REFERENTIALS_QUERYSTRING option added (controls whether to deaccentuate the referentials widget query string or not)
    * server side:
        * There is a new maven filter for mapfishapp temporary documents: shared.mapfishapp.docTempDir (defaults to /tmp/mapfishapp)
    * don't forget to edit your WMCs to activate back buffers on base layers, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/42
 * In GeoNetwork, it is now recommended to use OGC:WMS protocol rather than OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map (or any other WMS tagged with a version) to declare WMS layers, see https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/4
